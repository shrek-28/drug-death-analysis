# drug-death-analysis
This Excel project analyzes US overdose death rates by year, focusing on various opioid categories (any opioid, prescription, synthetic, heroin) and cocaine.  The analysis uses charts to explore trends over time and compares death rates between opioid types.  Additionally, formulas are used to calculate correlations between different overdoses.
